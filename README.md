# make_nc_CMPI6_GCMs
Prepares yearly .nc file for the Bias-corrected daily projections of precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature are developed using output from 13 CMIP6-GCMs for the 18 Indian sub-continental river basins.(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00681-1)

Also allows for cropping the .nc file for the study region(shapefile)
